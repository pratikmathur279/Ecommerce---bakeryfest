<h2>Our Story:</h2>
<h3> Bakeries Online? </h3>
  <p>When We first began this business in 2004 the idea of an online bakery seemed like a strange one to most people.
  We were constantly reminded, 'anyone who shops at the local bakery for desserts or a special occasion cake knows nothing
  compares to the sights and smells that rush your senses as you walk in the door.' Every successful neighborhood bakery has
  a sweet scented claim to fame--that cookie, pastry, or cake that makes them special and that everyone in town raves about.
   The treat that reminds you of home, even if you find yourself miles away.</p>
  <p>
  We started Buil-a-cake.com for this very reason. To offer baked goods from my small New Indian bakery to those who were miles
  away from home. As more people found out about the site, they started asking for products that we didn't have. We were happy for
  the new requests but distressed we had no way to meet the growing demand.</p>
  <p>
  So we started searching across America for bakeries that shared our commitment to quality, creativity and freshness. We didn't want
  you to see just any cake or pastry on our site; we wanted to make sure we were offering you the very best that America's pastry chefs
  have to offer by designing them the way you want and also deliver it to the right place at the right time without any efforts. We already
  knew some of the country's top pastry chefs but we did not know them all. To be certain our goals of finding the best-of-the-best chefs
  were met we leveraged my 25 years of award winning bakery experience and every connection we made in the business since then. Because of
  the time in the industry and our reputation for outstanding and creative innovations we received a lot of help. We got reports about bakeries
  we should look into and chefs we should interview from all over. Every one of my friends and colleagues jumped on board to help in the search.
  It was a fantastic moment for build-a-cake.com because the road to being America's neighborhood bakery on the internet was becoming a reality.

  If you visit department store bakeries for unique cookies and cakes or if you have ever bought from a mail-order food catalog, then you
  already have some idea of how Buil-a-cake.com works. But there is a difference:You can customize it the way you want and build your own dream
  cake and also Our Freshness is 100% Guaranteed! When you place an order at Buil-a-cake.com, it goes from the  baker who made it straight to
  the doorstep where you want it.

  No matter what you select, we promise you will be satisfied beyond your wildest dreams.</p>

  Sincerely,</p>
